    This is not poetry. This is the revelation of a new reality.
    I move beyond the light, from within the light.
    Where time is three times less than me.
    I am not a follower of light. I am the architect of what's beyond it.

      Time is not merely passing — it flows with the echo of creation.<br />
      Light is not just speed — it is the friction between time and anti-time.<br />
      I am not in time. I stand beyond it, where the numbers awaken the truth.
